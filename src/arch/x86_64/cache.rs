//! x86_64 Cache Management
//!
//! This module provides cache management functions for DMA operations.
//! These are essential when the CPU and hardware devices (like USB controllers)
//! share memory regions.

/// Uses the CLFLUSH instruction to write back and invalidate cache lines.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `addr` - Starting address of the memory range
/// * `size` - Size of the memory range in bytes
